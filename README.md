# Project Motivation

Climate Change is one of the biggest concerns in this coming decade.Different cities across the globe have taken various initiatives to promote sustainability for greener and cleaner planet.Copenhagen, capital of Denmark is identified as greenest city in 2020 and that makes it my top preference for analysis.
I wanted to understand how AirBnB listing have faired in this greenest city and how a traveler can interpret this analysis to make better decision when searching for accomodation in Copenhagen and contribute to sustainability by making informed choices.
